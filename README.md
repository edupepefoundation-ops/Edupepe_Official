# Edupepe Website v3 — Clean Humanitarian Style

This is a polished, Vercel-friendly Next.js site (pages/ routing) optimized for clarity and fast deploy.

## Quick deploy
1. Create a GitHub repo named `edupepe-website` and push these files (upload root contents directly).
2. Go to Vercel (https://vercel.com/new) → Import Project → select the GitHub repo → Deploy.
3. Add domain `edupepe.org` in Vercel settings and follow DNS steps.

If you see build errors, check that `package.json`, `pages/`, and `public/` are at repository root.
